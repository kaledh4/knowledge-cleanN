# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup Steps:

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/kaledh4/knowledge-cleanN

2. Click on "Settings" → "Pages" (in the left sidebar)

3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - Save

4. Add Required Secrets:
   - Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Add these secrets:
     * NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = your Supabase project URL
     * NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your Supabase anon key

5. Trigger Deployment:
   - Go to "Actions" tab
   - Click on "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
   - Wait for the deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)

6. Access Your Site:
   - Once deployed, your site will be at:
     https://kaledh4.github.io/knowledge-cleanN/

## What Was Configured:

✅ Next.js configured for static export
✅ Base path set to /knowledge-cleanN
✅ Images set to unoptimized mode
✅ GitHub Actions workflow created (.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)
✅ .nojekyll file added to public folder
✅ PWA support maintained
✅ Professional README with badges and documentation

## Automatic Deployments:

Every time you push to the main branch, GitHub Actions will:
1. Build the Next.js app
2. Export static files to /out folder
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages automatically

## Troubleshooting:

If deployment fails:
- Check that secrets are set correctly in repository settings
- Verify the workflow completed successfully in Actions tab
- Check that Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" as the source
- Look at workflow logs for specific errors

Your app is now ready for GitHub Pages! 🚀
